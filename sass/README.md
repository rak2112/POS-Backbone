SASS Racing Structure 
=============

SASS Directories
----------

1.  Base

	The base directory contains styles that help start a project. The base directory could contain the following type of SASS files:
	* Vendor dependancies (Compass, Foundation)
	* Authored dependancies (Mixins, variables)
	* Fonts
	* Reset

2.  Layout

	The layout directory contains styles that are large containers of a page. This directory could include SASS files like:
	* Responsive Grid
	* Page specific layouts

3.  Modules

	The modules directory will probably contain the bulk of your SASS files. A page may consist of multiple modules and should be style individually. 
	* Header
	* Footer
	* Navigation
	* Content Block

4.  Themes

	The themes directory contains any specific styles that a page may need to change from the generic layout or modules. For example the colours and images needed for different racing sections.

	* BTCC
	* BSB 
	* MX
